‚úçWhat are Data Structures?
- A way to store, organize & manage information(or data) in a way that allows you
the programmer to easily access or modify the values within them.
- Provide backbone to the programs
- Store information & access & manipulate information effectively
- Basic Data structures like => Password & online directories,etc
- Advanced Data structures Like => Autocomplete of text messages, undo, redo functions, etc
- Efficiency => the metrics used to judge the speed & Efficiency of different data structures

üíª (06:55) Measuring Efficiency with BigO Notation
- Quantifiable way to measure to how efficient certain data structures are at different tasks we might as of it 
 - Searching through
 - Modifying
 - Access
- The industry standard for this kind of measurement => BigO Notation
- BigO Notation => Based on four criteria
  - Accessing elements
  - Searching elements
  - Inserting elements
  - Deleting elements 
‚å®Ô∏è (09:45) Time Complexity Equations
   - Works by Inserting the size of the data-set as an integer n, and returning the number of operations that need to be conducted by the computer before the function can finish
   - The number of operations that need to be conducted by the computer before completion of that function
   - We always use the worst-case scenario when judging these data structures
‚å®Ô∏è (11:13) The Meaning of BigO
   - The syntax for the time complexity equations included a BigO and then a set of parenthesis
     - The parenthesis houses the function
     - A random function and its time complexity is measured based on the data sets, our integer n
     - n => number of operations
     - More data set => More instructions
‚å®Ô∏è (12:42) Why BigO?
     - We measure Efficiency in # of operations performed because measuring by how long the function takes to run would be silly => Measuring by time is biased towards better hardware
‚å®Ô∏è (13:18) Quick Recap
    - Measure Efficiency based on 4 metrics => Accessing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting
    - Modeled by an equation which takes in size of data-set n => number of operations needed to perform the task
‚å®Ô∏è (14:27) Types of Time Complexity Equations
    - O(1) =>Constant algorithm, absolute best, no matter what the size of your data set is , the task will be completed in a single instruction
    - O(log n) => Logarithmic algorithm, Next fastest type of time complexity, fast completion time, more efficient
    - O(n) => Linear algorithm Common time complexity, the last of the decent equations
    - O(n log n) => Relatively Bad
    - O(n2)=> Polynomial algorithm, Very bad in terms of Efficiency 
    - O(2n)=> Exponential algorithm, Very bad in terms of Efficiency
‚å®Ô∏è (19:42) Final Note on Time Complexity Equations
    - Time complexity equations are NOT the only metric you should be using the gauge which data structure to use 
    - Some provide other functionality that make them extremely useful
